## Test: clamp vector nothing

This runtime case exercises “clamp vector nothing” and verifies the declared messages, values, and execution result.

### Case description

  - name: "clamp vector nothing.ges"
    program: main
```

### Source code under test

```ges
module atomicmathmatrixjq

  let a be :Vector(1, 2, 3)
  let b be nothing
  let vNothing be nothing
  let vInteger be 10

  let vPercentage be 10%
  let vMeter be 10m
  let vBoolean be true
  let vTextNumber be '10.3'
  let vTextInvalid be 'hello'
  let vTagPi be pi
  let vTagNan be #nan
  let vTagInfinity be infinity
  let vVector be :Vector(1, 2, 3)
