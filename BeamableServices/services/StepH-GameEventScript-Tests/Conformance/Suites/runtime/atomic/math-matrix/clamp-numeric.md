## Test: clamp integer nothing

This runtime case exercises “clamp integer nothing” and verifies the declared messages, values, and execution result.

### Case description

```yaml

comparison:
  binary64:
    mode: ulp
    maxUlps: 4096

  - name: "clamp integer nothing.ges"
    program: main
```

### Source code under test

```ges
module AtomicMathMatrixEQ
on Start {
  let a be 10
  let b be nothing
  let vNothing be nothing
  let vInteger be 10
  let vFloat be 10.3
  let vPercentage be 10%
  let vMeter be 10m
  let vBoolean be true
  let vTextNumber be '10.3'
  let vTextInvalid be 'hello'
  let vTagPi be pi
  let vTagNan be #nan
  let vTagInfinity be infinity
  let vVector be :vector(1, 2, 3)
  let vPoint be :point(1, 2, 3)
  emit Done(nothing: clamp a between b and vNothing, integer: clamp a between b and vInteger, float: clamp a between b and vFloat, percentage: clamp a between b and vPercentage, meter: clamp a between b and vMeter, boolean: clamp a between b and vBoolean, textNumber: clamp a between b and vTextNumber, textInvalid: clamp a between b and vTextInvalid, tagPi: clamp a between b and vTagPi, tagNan: clamp a between b and vTagNan, tagInfinity: clamp a between b and vTagInfinity, vector: clamp a between b and vVector, point: clamp a between b and vPoint)
