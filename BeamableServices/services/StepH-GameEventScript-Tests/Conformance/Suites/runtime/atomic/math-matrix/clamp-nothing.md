## Test: clamp nothing nothing

This runtime case exercises “clamp nothing nothing” and verifies the declared messages, values, and execution result.

### Case description

```yaml

comparison:
  binary64:
    mode: ulp
    maxUlps: 4096
sources:
  - name: "clamp nothing nothing.ges"
    program: main
```

### Source code under test

```ges
module AtomicMathMatrixED
on Start {
  let a be nothing
  let b be nothing
  let vNothing be nothing
  let vInteger be 10
  let vFloat be 10.3
  let vPercentage be 10%
  let vMeter be 10m
  let vBoolean be true
  let vTextNumber be '10.3'
  let vTextInvalid be 'hello'
  let vTagPi be pi
  let vTagNan be #nan
  let vTagInfinity be infinity
  let vVector be :vector(1, 2, 3)
  let vPoint be :point(1, 2, 3)
